# Bayesian

The main algorithm is Polya_Gamma_ratio.R with which we did our tests with train and test sets.
Leave-One-Out.R is the performance computation with the LOO test.
Correlation Analysis.R are the correlation plots.
Actual Penalty Kicks prediction.R is the prediction of the two penalties out of the dataset that we included in our slides.
Test_successes.R and Test_beta.R are the two functional tests to check that our Polya-Gamma algorithm is viable.

There are two missing files about the classic logistic regression because of a forgotten USB key (they will be available from Thursday on).
